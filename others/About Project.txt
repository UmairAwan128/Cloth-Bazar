First according to industry get requirments from client and create an initial design/prototype to show the client that if
he requires this if he says yes this will be a prove that he accepted at these requirments and in future you will be secured
from any problem from the client.

In case of Visual Studio for creating a new project select a "BlankSolution" its in Installed->OtherProjectTypes->VisualStudioSolutions
the benfit of BlankSolution is that as our project will have many layers like Services,DB,Web  so these will be inside this solution as
seperate projects so The solution sapce name would be "ClothBazar" i.e our brandName and the projects inside this SolutionSpace
would be like ClothBazar_DB,ClothBazar_Web, e.t.c if we choosed Asp.netWebApplication at the start we will be naming it like ClothBazarWebsite
and this will be name of our solutionSpace also and webiste project also which will not be a good namming convention another benifit
of seperate projects is if tommorow e.g we want to add an entity we will just open the entity project or any ther thing we will open
that specific project and commit changes there so only that project .dll file will be updated not the all appplication also
if we want to transfer our web app to mobile we will just add mobileUI project and backend we will already having DB created.
1. Add a BlankSolution .
2. Add a Asp.netWebApplication project named "ClothBazar.Web" in this Solution. then select Mvc template also checkbox MVC refernece 
   and select the "Change Authentication" button and select the "Individual user Account" then click Ok so create this Project..
   we selected "Individual user Account" the benifit of selecting this is now when our this Webproject will be it will be 
   having Register and Login Functionality 100% complete and working  i.e even for this the Database will also be created
   so once you register your details will be saved in DB and then u can login any time....   
3. Added new ClassLibrary type project named "ClothBazar.Entities" Enitities will be in seperate project as if in the same
   "ClothBazar.Web" project there may be some referencing issues like circular dependency may be faced later..
4. Added new ClassLibrary type project named "ClothBazar.Database" this will be having the Database i.e contextClass,EntityFramework e.t.c
  

Controler can be shared i.e A controler can be having various Actions refering various Views but if An entity like Product
have various operations/Actions i.e more then one we seperately create such controler
Get: to get data/View
Post : to submit data/form
put: to update
Delete: to delete
To avoid circular dependeny b/w two project create a new project b/w them having the resoruce both projects need e.g
if Cloth.Web contains DB and as Cloth.Services need to access DB so it will refer to Cloth.Web and as Cloth.Web needs
to access services so it will add reference of Cloth.Services so circulardependency so solution is create Cloth.Database
and both will be refering to it like Many to Many relation and it will be b/w table..


Models: are not same as the Entity classes as in Entity we have a list of attributes if in a view we want to show/send all the
attributes of an entity or from View we want to sendback to Contler we will create an entity object in controler and pass that object
 to View or from View we will get data directly in entity class object ...
but in case on the view we want to show only some of the attributes of Entity to the View or we want to show some selected
attributes from Various entities e.g on HomePage we will be sending some of the Porduct Attributes some Categories and some other
so we will create a Model class having all that attributes and create that Modelclass object and pass it to the View or We mayBe 
recieving attributes from View to Controler e.g Student Enrollment Form for the Semester in that for we will be writting studentName
regNo other related info and also the list subjects that we are going to pick so as you can see here we get that this info is
for two tables i.e student Personal info for StudentTable and subjects he picked this info is for SubjectTable so as two tables 
so in this case a single ModelClass will be created that will be having both these classes attributes we need and then we 
will now get the data from View in this ModelClass object and then from this Model class we will send data to the required Entities  



Cookies:(it is a way of storing user related temporay data in user browser(RAM) not on Harddisk)(intrestingly using this we are shown related ADS)  
  What type of data is stored in Cookies : a data which is temporary type e.g while adding various products to cart
  this list is stored in UserPc but when its finalized(i.e user may remove a product) this data is sent to Server
Why AddToCart and UserRelated info is not stored in server but in the User Pc such data is cookies


Config class in ClothBazar.Entities :     the follwing class will have a list of attributes related to Site this will be info shown on the HomePage its like the
 related facebook/twitter account site contactNo or various headings like topDeals, summerArrivals e.t.c these values
 should not be hardcoded their values may be changed in future or we may be saling this Website to various clients
 so for such things(Links/Heading) we create a class traditionally named as Config.cs we named as myConfig in Entities Project so its table will
    be created and we store data/info we want to display and later on we can also change this info by accessing this class.
    but if we create a seperate attribute for each info i.e for related faceBook account we careted a if we carete an attribute here like
    "FBaccount" in table it will have only one value always all other attributes like this will have only one value so the table will have only one row
    so to avoid this we created two attributs in this class "key" and "value" both string key will have name like "FBaccount" and
    "Value" will have its realted value i.e facbook account link..    


URL Helper: (@URL("ActionName","ControlerName")) Some Websites have Coustomized URL for aceesing various parts of Site
right now our default convention is "/ControlerName/ActionName" we can change them also this may be benificial in SEO
in our site if we need to access any action/view we are now writting there path hardcoded as in case of Ajax req in JS code
we write   url: '/ContrlerName/ActionName'  also we need to remember its syntax so for ease we can write the same thing as

   
Pagination: Let say we have created our project and we have added thousands of products in it now in the View of ProductTable
i.e when we call to show/get all the products it will takw very long time to get all products and then show them in the table
also in this case the ProductTable will be very lengthy so the solution is pagination i.e in this case when we request to get
all the products from DB it will only get first 50 and show them then we will again request it to get the next 50 those
50 may be loaded below the early 50 or on the next page as per requirement so this concept Pagination will also increase
efficiency of Website and also Length..
In our project we applied two types of pagination 1 on productTable i.e our own created Pagination its like Google details can be
found here    	   second on CategoriesTbale
we applied Pagination from built in JQuery library for Pagination/Datatables found here    https://datatables.net/   for applying
this we included two files ref added on top of page found on the above link so that on our"CategoriesTable below Pagination will 
be applied also we need to assign id to that table and some JS code below in <script>___</script> i.e  just this on ready of the page  
   $('#myTable').DataTable();  and pagination is  applied but drawback is even this is not the true pagination as all records are
 loaded from DB even now not a few so slow startUp  will be faced when we have 10000 of records for minimizingg this problem we need 
to add some code on controler even create a seperate class and various servives which is explained in this Link   
       https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/using-datatables-grid-with-asp-net-mvc/


Data Validation: Validating data while reciving info from user to save it to DB e.g in Create Product form we should apply condition
on Name,Image field as required and Description as optional if we don,t apply such conditions we will also be able to save
a product which doesnot have a Name and Image i.e Empty Product so Validations are important and should be applied....
We Can Apply Such Validations in Two Ways 
1. By using DataAnnotations in Entity Classes i.e using [Required] on field u want as required and don,t write it for optional behaviour
   and [MinLength(5)] for defining the minimum lenght for a field  For all MVC DataAnnotations Search on google we refer the folling link
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-6  
   one Important thing that these DataAnnotations that we write in Entity Classes will be like Validation for the Server side only so for
   DataValidations on Client side we may be using JavaScript code or C# for showing Error Messsage we should apply both 
   as on Client side or Browser we can also disable JavaScript so inthis case this JavaScript Validation will be useless
   but in this case Server side validation will be there so either way we will have one Validation..
   SO for the Client/BrowserSide Validation we also write these same DataAnnotations what we write there in Entities also we write 
   them in the ModelClass(NewProductViewModel) as this Model class object is recieved by Create() or on Creation of Product so now 
   if(ModelState.isValid){ } written in Create() of Product becomes applicable and now it will only add a valid Product to DB 
   then we added this in create.cshtml 
   @*<span class="text-danger">*</span> below written in label is red * shows that this field is required*@
   <label> Name<span class="text-danger">*</span> </label>
   also added this error message
   fail(function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
   swal({
     title: "Warning",
     text: "Please enter all required fields.",
     icon: "warning",
     buttons: true,
     dangerMode: true,
   }) 
   Now we want to declare the input field as Required so we wrote this  <input name="Name" required /> but this will 
   not work as "required" works if we submit the form but as we are not submitting the form or we don,e have a button
   that has type=submit i.e <button type="Submit >Save</button> but using the JS code to send the data of all input
   fields to server i.e using the serialize() method so for the declaring any field Required we need to additionally
   write it JSCode on the click of Save button and also we need to inherit JqueryValidationScriptFile in our project
   for any file like this they are searched as "jquery validate cdn" and we download the link for the file here 
   https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-validate and the file link is 
   https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.17.0/jquery.validate.min.js  
   this file is also inkine so internet needed for this   ... 
    @*we wanted to declare the input fields in create.cshtml as Required so we wrote this  <input name="Name" required /> but this will
    not work as "required" works if we submit the form but as we are not submitting the form or we don,e have a button
    that has type=submit i.e <button type="Submit >Save</button> but using the JS code to send the data of all input

    https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-validate and the online file link is
    https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.17.0/jquery.validate.min.js
    we included it on top of index.cshtml this file needs internet as its online not in our project   ...*@
   @*and we used these links for help i.e how to use required and other using jquery for this we searched
    "Jquery form validation or Jquery Validation " on google and get for help https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
    https://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/ and  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15060292/a-simple-jquery-form-validation-script
       *@   //for this the syntax is use Validate() on the Form which you want to validate so
   //after this client side validation we should be make sure that on the click of save button the form should be valid
    //i.e all the fields value should be according to the conditions we defined in above in ("#createProduct").Validate(){}
    //and also according to the conditions/DataAnnotation we applied in Entity classes so

2.Fluent API i.e done by creating onModelCreation() method in Context class and in this we will define
     conditions/Attributes or relations for the fields or tables this mehtod willbe called while creaing Database
     
So fluent API/DataAnnotation is for Validation along the Server side but for the validation on client
side we will be either using JSCode/HTML
